            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here came Newes to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople</hi> of a strange Apparition or Vision, which was seene at <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dina Talnabi</hi> in <hi>Arabia,</hi> whereas <hi>Mahomet</hi> their great Prophet was buried: To visit whose Tombe the <hi>Turkes</hi> vse to goe in Pilgrimage, but they must first goe to <hi>Mecha,</hi> which is some few dayes Journey off, and there they take a ticket from the Grand Seigiours Beglerbeg, else they are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to goe to Medina.</p>
            <p>This Vision continued three weekes together, which terrified the whole Country, for that no man could discover the truth thereof.</p>
            <p>About the 20. of <hi>September,</hi> there fell so great a Tempest, and so fearefull a Thunder about mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, as the Heavens were darkned, and those
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:111893:3"/> that were awake were almost distracted, but the vapours being disperst, and the Element cleere, the People might read in Arabian Characters, these words in the Firmament, <hi>O why will you beleeve in Lies,</hi> betweene two and three in the morning, there was seene a woman in white, compassed about with the Sun, having a cheerfull countenance, holding in her hand a Book, comming from the Northeast, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite against her were Armies of <hi>Turkes, Persians, Arabians,</hi> and other <hi>Mahometans,</hi> ranged in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Battaile, and ready to charge her, but shee kept her standing, and onely opened the Booke, at the sight whereof the Armies fled, and presently all the Lamps about <hi>Mahomets</hi> Tombe went out, for as soone as ever the Vision vanished (which was commonly an houre before Sunne rising) a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring Wind was heard, whereunto they impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the extinguishing of the Lamps. The antient Pilgrims of Mahomets Race, who after they have visited this place, never use to cut their haire, were much amazed, for that they could not conceive he meaning of this Vision, onely one of the <hi>Dervices,</hi> which is a strict religious Order among the <hi>Turkes,</hi> like unto the Cappuchins amongst the Papists, and live in contemplation, stepped up very boldly and made a Speech unto the Company which incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed them much against him, so as the poore Priest for his plain dealing lost his life, as you shall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after heare.</p>

                  <hi>THe</hi> Dervice <hi>his Speech was this:</hi> That the VVorld had never but three true Religions, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one of which had a Prophet; first, God those the Iewes, and did wonders for them in Aegypt, and brought them forth by their Prophet <hi>Moses, who</hi> prescribed them a Law, wherein he would have main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained them if they had not beene obstinate and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious, and fallen to Idolatry; whereupon hee gave them over, and scattered them upon the face of the Earth. Then presently be raised a new Prophet who taught the Christian Religion. This good man the Iewes condemned and crucified for a seducer of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, not moved with the Piety of his life, his great Miracles nor his Doctrine. Yet after his death, the Preaching of a few Fishermen did so move the hearts of men, as the greatest Monarches of the World bowed to his very title, and yeelded to the command of his Ministers. But it seemes they grew as corrupt as the <hi>Iewes,</hi> their Church being dismembred with the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction of the <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West,</hi> committing Idolatry againe by setting up of Images, with many other idle Ceremonies, besides the corruption of their lives, so as God was weary of them too, and not onely sent Divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons among them, but forsooke them, dispossessing them of their chiefest Cities, <hi>Jerusalem</hi> and <hi>Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi>
